# Architecture Log

A chronological record of BadaBhai's architectural **state and changes** — the
"how did we get here" companion to the always-current
[architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md). Append an entry whenever the
shape of the system changes (new component, new seam, new contract surface, a
boundary moved).

---

## 2026-06-22 — CORS is now env-driven + fail-closed (TD30, not an ADR)
- **Boundary tightened, not moved.** The browser-facing API's CORS policy went from
  unconditionally open (`app.enableCors()` in every env) to an env-driven origin
  allow-list. [`main.ts`](../../apps/api/src/main.ts) now applies
  `enableCors(corsOptions(config))` ([`packages/config/src/server.ts`](../../packages/config/src/server.ts)),
  gated by a new fail-closed `assertCorsConfig(config)` boot guard sitting next to
  `assertPiiCryptoConfig`/`assertAuthConfig`/`assertPaymentsConfig`/`assertPayerAuthConfig`.
- **Per-env origin model.** New `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env (CSV → trimmed `string[]`);
  `assertCorsConfig` throws at boot when the list is empty outside an explicit
  development/test env (keyed off the canonical [`isDevEnv()`](../../packages/config/src/shared.ts) /
  RAW `NODE_ENV` — the R14 fail-closed rule, never the fail-open parsed value). Dev
  reflects any origin; staging/prod use the exact list and MUST include BOTH the ops
  console ([`apps/web`](../../apps/web), which fetches the API client-side) and
  payer-web origins. `credentials:false` (Bearer-header auth, not cookies);
  `exposedHeaders` carries `x-session-token` so cross-origin payer-web can read the
  rolling payer session.
- **Transport-only — faceless spine untouched.** No schema, event, or PII change; no
  new component or contract surface. **Not an ADR** — the per-env origin model is
  uncontested. Backward-compatible: dev boot unchanged; staging/prod now require the
  allow-list (intended fail-closed).
- Closes [TD30](./tech-debt-register.md) (R14's split-out CORS gap; cross-link
  [R14](./risks-register.md)).

## 2026-06-15 — Contact Unlock + Reveal Stream A backend landed (ADR-0010)
- **New contract surface: the routed-disclosure monetization spine.** Contact
  Unlock is the one feature that deliberately discloses a worker's contact channel
  to a paying party — the highest-risk PII path in the product. Stream A (backend
  core) landed behind a written, human-gated contract; **ADR-0010 Accepted
  (2026-06-15, Prakash)** with the F-1..F-7 controls folded in, and the build was
  authorized only post-sign-off + after the [PII-disclosure threat model](../security/contact-unlock-threat-model.md)
  passed (bb-security-review = **PASS**; the one High finding **F-A** — an
  unknown-worker FK-500 oracle — was fixed + has a CI regression test).
- **New data shape: four additive, PII-FREE tables + one additive column.**
  `unlocks` (one routed-contact grant — `payer_id` opaque/no-FK, `worker_id` → the
  only identity join, `status`/`routing_token_ref`/`reveal_count`/`expires_at`),
  `payer_credits` (mock balance), `credit_ledger` (append-only credit movements),
  `unlock_routing` (token → `worker_id` + channel enum + expiry, **schema-proven
  phone-free**), plus `jobs.payer_id` (opaque, nullable). **No phone, name, proxy
  number, or contact string in any column** — "PII lives only in `workers`" holds.
  Migration `0014` (additive; RLS-locked via REVOKE per TD20). **Table count:
  16 → 20.**
- **New event family: 8 additive v1 events, PII-FREE (ids/enums/counts only).**
  `unlock.requested|granted|denied|cap_exceeded`, `contact.revealed`
  (**channel KIND only** — `in_app_relay`/`proxy_number`, never the destination),
  `payment.authorized|captured|failed` (every one `real_call: false` in alpha).
  New event domains `unlock`/`contact`/`payment` + the `unlock` subject; the
  `payer` actor already existed. **No ADR-0006/0009 payload mutated** (invariant 8).
- **New consent purpose + a fail-closed disclosure gate.** `employer_sharing`
  added to `CONSENT_PURPOSES` (the enum already reserved it); a purpose-scoped
  sibling of `ConsentGuard` gates every reveal, fails closed, and is revocable —
  disclosure to a payer is a *distinct* DPDP purpose from profiling.
- **New seam: a single fail-closed chokepoint.** `UnlockGuardService` is the only
  writer of `unlocks` and the only resolver of `routing_token_ref`; the ordering is
  **consent → caps → payment → grant → routed-reveal**, each gate denying and
  disclosing nothing on failure (no-oracle neutral response). The raw phone is read
  (`PiiCryptoService.decrypt`) **only** at the routed-reveal step, server-side, once,
  handed to the in-app relay, and discarded — never in an event/log/response.
- **Alpha posture (interim, flagged):** payer routes ride `InternalServiceGuard`
  (no per-payer auth yet — `PayerAuthGuard` is a launch gate, [TD33](./tech-debt-register.md)/[R16](./risks-register.md));
  reveal is **in-app relay only** (no telephony provider, no raw number leaves
  BadaBhai — [R18](./risks-register.md)); payments are a **mock credit ledger**
  (`PAYMENTS_ENABLE_REAL=false` — [TD34](./tech-debt-register.md)/[R17](./risks-register.md)).
  **226 API tests + e2e green.**
- **Next, gated streams:** payer UI (Stream B), real Razorpay credit-pack purchase
  ([TD34](./tech-debt-register.md)), and `PayerAuthGuard` ([TD33](./tech-debt-register.md))
  — each a separate gated step. DPDP `employer_sharing` notice copy + a
  retention/erasure policy ([R19](./risks-register.md)/[TD35](./tech-debt-register.md))
  must land before any non-mock disclosure.
- See [ADR-0010](../decisions/0010-contact-unlock-and-reveal.md) and the
  [threat model](../security/contact-unlock-threat-model.md).

## 2026-06-15 — Alpha swipe-to-apply surface landed (ADR-0009)
- **New contract surface: a sanctioned scoped producer for the ADR-0006 events.**
  The `feed.shown` / `application.submitted` / `application.skipped` v1 events
  (defined "contract ahead of producer" in ADR-0006) now have a real, honest
  producer. **No event payload version bump** — alpha passes seed-order `rank` and
  lets `score`/`hot` take their safe defaults (`0` / `false`), the truthful values
  for an unranked surface (the AI-never-ranks pillar is untouched, invariant 4).
- **New data shape: two additive, PII-free tables.** `jobs` (seeded, coarse —
  `trade_key`/`title`/`city`/`area`/`status`; **no employer name, pay, or contact**)
  and `applications` (`job_id`/`worker_id` FKs, `action`/`reason`/`source_surface`/
  `rank`; UNIQUE `(worker_id, job_id)`, last-write-wins upsert; CHECK `reason` only
  on skip). The only identity reference is `applications.worker_id` → `workers`;
  **"PII lives only in `workers`" holds.** Migration `0012_nosy_retro_girl.sql`
  (additive; not yet applied to a shared DB — needs sign-off per CLAUDE.md §7);
  idempotent seed `packages/db/src/seed-jobs.ts` (17 jobs across all 15 alpha
  trades). **Table count: 14 → 16.**
- **New API module + a new shared guard.** `apps/api/src/applications` —
  `GET /feed`, `POST /applications/:jobId/apply|skip` (worker, consent-gated,
  idempotent) + `GET /jobs/:jobId/applicants` and `GET /workers/:workerId/applications`
  (`InternalServiceGuard`, PII-free projections). New reusable `ConsentGuard`
  (`apps/api/src/auth/consent.guard.ts`) — the first "require active consent before
  this action" primitive (resolves ADR-0009 OQ-1).
- **New seam, clients:** read-only ops applicant views in `apps/web`
  (server-only `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`, PII-free) and a worker swipe screen in
  `apps/worker-app` (`swipe_jobs_screen.dart` + `ApiClient` feed/apply/skip). The
  worker session bearer token is now plumbed into the `ApiClient` (memory-only,
  never logged) — the capstone "swipe" flow gap is closed **in code** (device
  verification still pending).
- **Phase-2 surfaces remain OUT** (restated, not changed): Reach ranking/scoring,
  employer console/posting, unlock/contact, payments/payouts/boosts, real matching.
  Crosses the Phase-1/2 line narrowly + deliberately, human-gated (Accepted
  2026-06-15, Prakash).
- See [ADR-0009](../decisions/0009-alpha-swipe-to-apply-seeded-jobs.md).

## 2026-06-15 — LiteLLM → direct Gemini/Claude providers (ADR-0008)
- **Seam clarified, not moved.** The provider abstraction is the
  `LlmAdapter`/`AIRouter` boundary; behind it `app/ai/providers.py` dispatches to
  **direct** transports — `gemini_client.py` (REST/httpx, primary) and
  `anthropic_client.py` (anthropic SDK, fallback) — chained **Gemini → Claude
  Haiku → deterministic mock**. The never-wired LiteLLM adapter is retired;
  `app/llm.py` remains only as the named seam example.
- **No new event, table, or contract surface;** no runtime behaviour change. The
  pseudonymization gateway still runs fail-closed upstream of every call.
- **Env unified (TD28):** Node `packages/config` now uses `GEMINI_FLASH_API_KEY`
  (master) + optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; `LITELLM_API_KEY` kept as a deprecated alias.
- **Still open:** no cumulative spend cap (TD27/R6) — the ADR names the
  `cost_tracker`/`AIRouter.run` hook for it.
- See [ADR-0008](../decisions/0008-litellm-to-direct-providers.md).

## 2026-06-09 — Async extraction (BullMQ) + action-recording seam (ADR-0002)
- **New seam: a BullMQ/Redis queue.** `/profile/extract` is now async — it
  enqueues a `profile-extraction` job (returns `202` + `ai_job_id`); a
  `ProfileExtractionProcessor` (in-process for Phase 1) does the AI work and
  emits `profile.extraction_completed`/`failed`. Clients poll `GET /ai-jobs/:id`.
- **New contract surface: action recording.** `POST /actions` + `/actions/batch`
  append a generic, extensible `action.recorded` event (controlled `action_type`
  as *data*) to the existing `events` spine — the behavioural stream for the
  future Learn layer. No new table.
- **Event count: 20 → 22** (`profile.extraction_failed`, `action.recorded`); new
  event domain `action`.
- **New external dependency on the extraction path:** Redis (already in stack).
- See [ADR-0002](../decisions/0002-async-extraction-and-action-recording.md).

## 2026-06-09 — Ops read-path + apps wired to live API
- API gained read-only ops endpoints (workers, events, ai-jobs).
- Next.js ops console wired to the live API (read-only).
- Flutter worker-app `ApiClient` replaced mock with real HTTP + typed models.
- Phase-1 e2e flow test added.
- *No new seams* — this fills in the existing event-first / repository-service
  architecture. Schema frozen for the (future) LLM layer: embeddings,
  model_training, storage tiers.

## 2026-06-08 — Architecture frozen for Phase 1 (ADR-0001)
Established the load-bearing shape the rest of the system hangs off:
- **Event-first.** `events` table is the spine + audit log; every important
  endpoint emits a validated event ([`@badabhai/event-schema`](../../packages/event-schema/), 22 events as of ADR-0002).
- **AI privacy boundary in the FastAPI service.** Pseudonymization runs before any
  LLM call and **fails closed**; PII never crosses to an LLM.
- **Repository/service separation** in the NestJS API over Drizzle; DI throughout.
- **Shared typed packages:** event-schema, db, config, types, validators,
  taxonomy, ai-contracts; reach-engine intentionally a placeholder.
- **Data shape:** 10 tables; PII (phone, full name) only in `workers`; events /
  ai_jobs / audit_logs carry ids/hashes only.
