 *
 * ALPHA = MOCK CREDITS ONLY. `real_call` is always the honest `false` here because no
 * real gateway runs (the analogue of `AiCostRecordedPayload.real_call`). A real
 * Razorpay-style implementation slots in behind this same interface, behind
 * `PAYMENTS_ENABLE_REAL` (default false) + a provider key, staging-first, with human
 * sign-off (CLAUDE.md §7). `assertPaymentsConfig` fails the boot CLOSED if the flag is
 * on without a key, so a half-configured real gateway can never silently run as mock.
 *
 * The UNLOCK DEBIT is tx-scoped ({@link debitOneCreditWithinTx}) so it commits ATOMICALLY
 * with the grant write in the chokepoint's single transaction (F-6: no
 * debit-without-grant / grant-without-debit). The DB CHECK (balance >= 0) + the atomic
 * conditional decrement make a negative balance impossible.
