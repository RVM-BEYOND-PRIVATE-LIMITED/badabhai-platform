 * Wire contract for the payer-authenticated SELF read (ADR-0019 LC-1, slice 1; PROF-1).
 *
 * This is the backend shape behind `GET /payer/me`. It is the payer's view of their OWN
 * account, returned ONLY over their own authenticated session. `orgName`, `email`, and the
 * masked `phoneLast4` are the payer's own contact data (server→client to themselves) — which
 * is acceptable here BUT must never be eventized or logged (invariant #2 / B-R2: `payer_id`
 * is the only token in events/logs). The phone is returned MASKED (last 4 only); the raw
 * E.164 number is never sent. Sourced by decrypting the `payers` ciphertext columns inside
 * the self-scoped service — never on a list/admin path.
 *
 * Mirrors the `apps/payer-web` `payerMeWireSchema` (Zod↔Zod parity).
